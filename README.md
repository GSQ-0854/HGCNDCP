 1. You need to run the "extractor_train.py " file first
 2.  then the "main.py" file.
 
 ## Dataset
 
The data set was fromGDSC, including 183 drugs with both chemical structural characteristics and drug response data, and 962 cell lines with both genomic characteristics and drug response data. 125647 sensitive responses and 33595  resistance responses.
